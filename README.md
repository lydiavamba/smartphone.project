Smartphone Personality Classification Project üì±üß†
This project explores how individual smartphone usage behavior relates to personality traits. Using a classification model, we aim to predict a person‚Äôs personality type based on behavioral metrics such as screen time, app usage, and social interaction preferences.

üìÇ Project Overview
Notebook: smartphone.project.ipynb

Goal: Predict user personality traits based on smartphone behavior using classification algorithms.

Tech Stack: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Models Used: Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM)# smartphone.project

‚öôÔ∏è Methodology
Data Preprocessing

Handled missing values

Encoded categorical variables

Scaled features using StandardScaler

Exploratory Data Analysis

Visualized distributions and outliers using histograms and boxplots

Analyzed class distribution and feature correlations

Model Training

Split dataset into training and testing sets

Trained Logistic Regression, KNN, and SVM models

Compared model performance using accuracy and ROC AUC scores

Evaluation

Plotted ROC curves for all models

Selected the best-performing model based on AUC

üìà Results
Each model‚Äôs performance was evaluated using:

Accuracy Score,Confusion Matrix,Classification Report,ROC Curve and AUC Score

 Requirements
Python 3.x

pandas
